# copy-code-with-info README

This extension is used to copy code along with necessary information. The information includes the opened folder, current file, language, line numbers, and other details.

One usage example is: when pasting it in Obsidian-Excalidraw, it will generate a code snippet with a backlink. Clicking on the backlink will open the corresponding folder and file in vscode, and navigate to the line number of that code snippet.
