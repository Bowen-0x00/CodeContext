# Code-Context

Code-Context is a Visual Studio Code extension that enables users to copy code with additional context information, such as the programming language, file path, and line number. This metadata can be utilized for creating links, documenting code, or other custom uses, enhancing the way you manage and share code snippets.

One usage example is: when pasting it in Obsidian-Excalidraw, it will generate a code snippet with a backlink. Clicking on the backlink will open the corresponding folder and file in vscode, and navigate to the line number of that code snippet.
